	Libstats is meant to, in the short term, replace LPU's own Library Interface with a more user friendly and versatile option. The current set of features included are search filters specific to students including Semester and Course as well as the content type of the book. Coming features which require a User Account Management include recommending books based on their programme and Instruction Plans. Other soon to be implemented features are using custom algorithms to improve the recommended books system to make sure you see the books that best suit you. The algorithm is meant to improve as you view more books.<br>
	The Website, if supported is planned to be linked to the UMS, and an App for user convenience is also in the plan of action.
	The long term applications include expanding the website/App outside of the University to include more educational systems and public libraries as well as supporting E-Commerce listings for books.<br>
	
	To enhance user experience even further, we intend to implement a system that can help you issue your books from home and have them be delivered to you, while also maintaining a timer to remind you to return the book or have it returned.
